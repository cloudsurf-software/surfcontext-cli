We chose Rust for the surf-parse crate due to its strong type system,
zero-cost abstractions, and excellent error handling.

## Executive Summary

::summary
The SurfDoc format provides a markdown superset with typed block directives,
enabling structured documents that degrade gracefully to plain markdown.

# Q1 2026 Product Strategy Review

::summary
CloudSurf is executing a multi-product strategy with TaskSurf as the lead product.
Revenue target is $5K MRR by end of Q2, driven by TaskSurf subscriptions and
Wavesite upsells. Patent portfolio provides defensive moat with 16 families filed.
::

## Current Product Status

::data
| Product | Stage | MRR | Users | Priority |
|---------|-------|-----|-------|----------|
| TaskSurf | Beta | $0 | 12 | P0 |
| Wavesite | Production | $500 | 45 | P1 |
| NoteSurf | Alpha | $0 | 8 | P2 |
| SurfContext | OSS | $0 | 0 | P1 |
::

::callout[type=tip title="Revenue Priority"]
Focus engineering effort on TaskSurf billing activation. Every week of delay
costs approximately $2K in potential MRR based on pipeline conversations.
::

## Key Decisions

::decision[status=accepted date="2026-02-08"]
Absorb CloudSurf HQ into TaskSurf. The standalone dashboard adds maintenance
overhead without differentiated value. AI chat, agent personas, and strategy
features become TaskSurf premium tier capabilities.
::

::decision[status=proposed date="2026-02-10"]
Evaluate SST v3 migration for TaskSurf backend. Amplify Gen 2 is blocking
custom domain configuration and advanced caching. Migration cost estimated
at 2-3 engineering days.
::

## Growth Metrics

::metric[label="MRR" value="$500" trend=up unit="USD"]
::

::metric[label="Active Users" value="65" trend=up]
::

::metric[label="Churn Rate" value="2.1%" trend=down unit="monthly"]
::

## Technical Roadmap

::tasks
- [x] TaskSurf billing integration
- [x] Knowledge docs feature
- [x] GitHub App infrastructure
- [ ] First paying customer
- [ ] iOS app submission @brady
- [ ] SST migration evaluation
::

## Risk Assessment

::callout[type=danger]
Single-founder dependency remains the highest operational risk. Brady is the
sole engineer, designer, and business operator. Any extended absence would
halt all product development across the portfolio.
::

::code[lang=toml file="risk-matrix.toml"]
[risks.founder-dependency]
severity = "critical"
likelihood = "medium"
mitigation = "Document everything, automate CI/CD, maintain ARDS"

[risks.runway]
severity = "high"
likelihood = "low"
mitigation = "Client services revenue covers burn for 12+ months"
::

## Next Steps

1. Activate TaskSurf billing for first customers
2. Submit iOS app to App Store
3. File remaining patent provisionals before public ARDS launch
4. Apply to StartUpNV accelerator

::callout[type=info]
Quarterly review scheduled for March 31, 2026. All metrics will be
re-evaluated against targets at that time.
